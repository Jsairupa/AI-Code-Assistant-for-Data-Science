# AI-Code-Assistant-for-Data-Science

This is a simple and powerful AI assistant that helps with data science tasks like data cleaning, visualization, and model building using just a CSV file and a text prompt.

You upload your dataset and describe what you want to do, and the app will generate:
- âœ… Suggested cleaning steps
- âœ… Python code (with pandas, seaborn, sklearn)
- âœ… Easy-to-understand explanations for each step

It works with both:
- ðŸ”¹ OpenAI models (like GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- ðŸ”¹ Local models using Ollama (like Mistral, Gemma)
